\section{Introduction}
In this paper we describe extensions to the L3 translation system for
under-resourced languages.

L3 seeks to address the problem of the Linguistic Digital Divide.

* why is ambiguity a problem for RBMT?


* background with XDG


* how to integrate classifiers with L3


* add possible output words as features (does that help? we think it shouldnâ€™t,
and can demonstrate with this experiment that ...)


SMT systems have used classifiers for CL-WSD and CL-PSD with varying success;
it seems to help somewhat. The language model for the target language is
helpful in local disambiguations, largely due to the left-to-right decoding
process.

However, in a rule-based system, and particularly in the case of translation
for under-resourced languages...

\section{Cross-Language Word Sense Disambiguation}
CL-WSD is distinct from the well-studied monolingual case, in that in the
cross-language case, the senses of a word in the target language are taken to
be only those that are distinct word types in the target language. Thus, for
example, if a word in the source language is always translated as the same word
in the target language, then there is no ambiguity to resolve, even if 

This approach has a long history in the translation literature, dating back to
Brown et al 1991...

More recently, Carpuat and Wu have integrated this into modern phrase-based SMT
systems ...  \cite{carpuatpsd} \cite{improvingsmtwsd}

\section{Classifier development}
For these experiments, we generated XXX sentences of English/Amharic bitext
from a simple grammar with lexical preferences baked in, such as those shown in
Figure XX, then trained 

\section{Classifier integration}

\section{Results}
The classifiers were able to learn the appropriate lexical preferences with
XX\% accuracy. They differed from the most frequent sense in XX\% of the time,
showing that they in fact were able to learn something useful.

On a modern desktop computer, the system took XXX seconds to return the first
translation. As judged by one of the authors, the most preferable translation
was produced as the top-scored translation, and first, in XX of the cases.

\section{Ongoing Work}
Clearly in the future our classifiers should be trained on real-world data
instead of a generated toy corpus. We would like to continue generalizing this
work to apply to other languages instead of just English/Amharic ...


In the medium term, we will integrate our RBMT system with interfaces for
computer-aided translation (CAT) in order to produce documents in
under-resourced languages
