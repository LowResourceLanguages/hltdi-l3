Assuming the "analyze" command from FreeLing is on your path, this should work
for getting nice tokenized, tagged and lemmatized output for the sentences in
testsentence.txt.

$ analyze -f es.cfg --outf tagged < testsentence.txt

To get the output of the dependency parser, just change "tagged" to "dep"

$ analyze -f es.cfg --outf dep < testsentence.txt
