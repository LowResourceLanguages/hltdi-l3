This is disambiguatr, a Python system for cross-language word sense
disambiguation, focusing on Spanish-to-Quechua lexical choice.

disambiguatr is part of the L3 Project.

---------------------------
| files in this directory |
---------------------------
qu_stories.txt is a bunch of text from Quechua, collected by CMU's Avenue
project. That collected corpus is available linked from the HLTDI L3 wiki. The
files are just the ones from the "Electronic texts" directory in that archive,
concatenated together and converted to utf8.

| how to run the experiments |
------------------------------

## extract, from the dictionaries, the ambiguous translation pairs
$ ./ambiguouswords.py

## now find instances of those translation pairs in the bitext bibles.
## this will append test cases to the files in testcases/*, so you might want
## to delete them all first, if they're present already.
$ ./extractbibles.py

## next, run the classifier. Running this script will tell you which
## classifiers are available. Pick one and specify it on the command line to
## run the 10-fold cross validation experiments.
$ ./runtests.py
